Final Exam Review


* background

Section II, IV

*Spring, 2018*

*Professor N. Nedzel*

*Office Hours*

My office is # 293 in the second floor faculty suite, and my office
hours are Mondays and Wednesdays, 2:30-5:15 as well as Tuesdays 11-2
p.m. I am also often available on Thursday and Saturdays when Doctrinal
Reviews are scheduled. If I am in my office, I am almost always
available to students -- just ask Ms. Williams (my administrative
assistant) or one of the other secretaries to contact me. Alternatively,
please feel free to make an appointment with me for a different time at
our mutual convenience. It's easiest to reach me via my SULC email
address: [[mailto:nnedzel@sulc.edu][nnedzel@sulc.edu]].

*Studying Civil Code*

The sheer number of articles you are responsible for learning,
especially in Obligations, can be overwhelming. Nevertheless, I will
expect your knowledge of the topic to be precise, concise, and complete.
*The only way to do this is to study the Code chapter by chapter* (*i.e.
study topics, do NOT try to memorize article by article), incorporating
interpretational concepts from the cases and comments as you go. If you
find yourself struggling, reach out for help early on.* The advantage of
the Civil Code is that each article is short and clear and is presented
in context. The only way to learn them is in context.

*Syllabus*

We will cover approximately 30 pages for each class session. To be well
prepared, prepare 7 cases ahead of the class at all times. The following
syllabus is subject to change as needed. In addition to briefing the
cases in the Litvinoff casebook and those listed in the syllabus, /you
must prepare the applicable Civil Code articles/. Generally, the
applicable articles are listed under the title to each section of the
text and also referenced in the syllabus, but you may need to read
additional articles. Read the articles referenced at the beginning of
the section BEFORE you read the section (I do NOT require that you
compare them to the 1870 Code articles included in the back of the
text). The articles referenced in the case excerpts themselves may or
may not be current. You will be responsible ONLY for current articles,
so with every case, ask yourself whether the result would be the same
under the current civil code articles. Note that some assignments
include supplemental materials, listed in bold. You are responsible for
preparing these as well and any additional materials announced on TWEN
or in class.

C. to familiarize students with how to apply these concepts in different
factual situations;

properly address and answer an exam that includes both hypotheticals and
multiple choice questions relating to obligations like those used in the
Code III section of the Louisiana Bar Exam.

A. be able to accurately identify obligations issues
