* liability upon fault

** intro
   tort from tortus, twisted, french meaning injury or wrong. is a civil wrong other than a breach of contract. "this area of law imposes duties on persons to act in a manner that will not injure other persons. a person who breaches a tort duty has committed a tort and may be liable to pay damages in a lawsuit brought by a person injured because of that tort."

   major purposes
1. provide a peaceful means for adjusting the rights of parties who might otherwise "take the law into their own hands"
2. to deter wrongful conduct
3. to encourage socially responsible behavior
4. to restore injured parties to their original condition, insofar as the law can do this, by compensating them for their injry.

*** notion of tresspass versus case

    trespass rooted in criminal law and direct harm. tresspass on the case was a special writ to be applied for on your circumstances; more indirect. the former required no damages as the force and intrusion on the person was enough, accordingly it found no requirement for fault. The latter, being more indirect, required actual damages and attribution or culpability. While tresspass was partly criminal, the case was purely civil to being with; the criminal part of tresspass fell away in the late 1600s. Due to precedence, the actual damages requirement did not fall away with the criminal component but courts were reluctant to extend this standard to the torts descending from tresspass on the case.

** Anonymous

   Kings Bench, 1466

*** Rule

    "if a man does a thing he isbound to do it in such a manner that by his deed no injury or damage is inflected upon others."

*** Reasoning

    There seems to be no case and here the judge is acting apparently as counsel in this case. Seems to be a summary of well settled law at the time.

** weaver v ward

   King's Bench 1616

*** Procedural History

    military man against military man, weaver brings suit against ward for trespass of assault and battery. in a training maneuver, gun discharges and wounds the other.

*** Questions Presented



*** Rule

    "yet in trespass, which tends only to give damages according to hurt or loss, it is not so; and therefore if a lunatick hurt a man, he shall be answerable in trespass; and therefore no man shall be excused of a tresspass (for this is the nature of an ecuse, and not of a jstification), except it may be judged utterly without his fault."

*** Reasoning

    Criminal interaction requires the criminal mind, civil liability requires damages. The court separates things from which you are not liable, a strong standard to reach "as if a man by force take my hand and strike you, or if here the defendant had said, that the plaintiff ran cross his piece when it was discharging" or if the result was "inevitable and that the defendant had committed no negligence to give occasion to the hurt".

*** Holding

    Ward was responsible for damages to Weaver

*** Main Takeaway

    The standard for liability is "negligence" and based on damages no criminal mind. however, "this is the earliest known case in which it was clearly recognized that a defendant might not be liable, even in a trespass action, for a purely accidental injury occurring entirely without his fault." maybe damages plus? damages plus tie him to it.

** brown v kendall

   Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, 1850

*** Procedural History

    Two dogs fighting. Defendant, Kendall, in trying to separate them, injuries Brown. In original trial jury is given instructions that the standard of care is in how necessary it was to separate the dogs. For instance, if it were "necessary ... then defendant was required to use only ordinary care in doing it; but if it were only a proper and permissible act, defendant was liable unless he exercised extraordinary care; and that the burden of proving the extraordinary care was on the defendant".

    find in favor of plaintiff and defendant appeals.

*** Questions Presented

    In an "inadvertant and unintentional [injury]: how far, and under what qualificatoins, the party by whose unconscious act the damage was done is responsible for it".

    Does tresspass have some component more than just damages?

*** Rule

    "that when the proof is all in, and before the jury, from whatever side it comes, and whether directly proved, or inferred from circumstances, it it appears that the defendant was doing a lawful act, and unintentionally hit and hurt the plaintiff, then unless it also appears to the satisfaction of the jury, that the dfendant is chargeable with some fault, negligence, carelessness, or want or prudence, the plaintiff fails to sustain the burden of proof, and is not entitled to recover.

    Overturning "that damage received by a direct act of force from another will be sufficient to maintain an action of trespass, whether the act was lawful or unlawful, and neither wilful, intentional, or careless.

*** Reasoning

    Overturning the notion that in injury lay liability. the courts confused the claim of action with what it required. For instance, tresspass was for direct injury and case for indirect; it eventually became conflated that any direct injury _was_ a tresspass and the other had to be proved. This notion is tossed out on its head for an intent based regime.

    Flatly tossed out liability from acts of "duty" vs those which are merely "proper and lawful". Not intentional and part of a lawful act; if you want to charge undue care then that is your burden.

*** Holding

    Sent back for a new trial to reflect the shifting of proving due care on the defendant to proving undue care on the plaintiff.

*** Main Takeaway

    Intent not fault is the source of liability.
** cohen v petty

   court of appeals of the district of columbia, 1933

*** Procedural History

    Petty was driving, said he felt sick, fainted and the car ran off the road, permanently injuring plaintiff. Having uncontested testimony that petty said "I feel sick" and then fainted, Trial court directs a verdict, preventing jury consideration.

*** Questions Presented

    Can the court find negligence, or even allow for a jury to find negligence, in a man who becomes sick and faints when he had no knowledge of any illness.

*** Rule

    no

*** Reasoning

*** Holding

    the lower court was correct in not letting this go to jury

*** Main Takeaway

    Seriousness of injury, etc, are not the source of liability. it is intent or negligence which must be shown by the evidence.

** spano v perini corp

   court of appeals NY 1969

*** Procedural History

    Blasting for constructing a tunnel damages cars in nearby or adjacent garage. Sue for damages, winning for plaintiffs (not sure what spano is as this is a combined case). Judgement reveresed on appeal and that affirmed on another appeal landing finally in this case.

*** Questions Presented

*** Rule

    Limit to the negligence standard and a glimpse of our ancient tort foundations.

*** Reasoning

    Both defendants  allege negligence but neither tries to show in what capacity, relying solely on "absolute liability". its just crazy dangerous. "in such a case, the rule which exonerates a party engaged in a lawful business, when free from negligence, has no application".

*** Holding

    Return to a lower court to check the evidence to ensure that the damage is in fact cause by the blasting. "the fact that the magazine was liable to such a contingency, which could not be guarded against or averted by the greatest degree of care and vigilance, evinces its dangerous character... In such a case, the rule which exonerates a party engaged in a lawful business, when free from negligence, has no application".

*** Main Takeaway

    The negligence plus standard is not absolute. Absolute liability seems to return back to the ancient roots of torts of sole damage but it makes sense in this case. Categorically has been applied by "[t]he overwhelming majority of American jurisdictoins"

* intent

** garrat v dailey

*** Procedural History
    Supreme Court of Washington 1955

    Ruling in favor of Garrat in past. Focused on lack of intent to cause harm "did not have purpose, intent or design to perform a prank or to effect an assault and battery upon the person of the plaintiff" Garrat appeals

*** Questions Presented

    What is intent.

*** Rule

    Battery, for these purposes, is the intentional infliction of a harmful bodily contact upon another.

    "the act must be done for the purpose of causing the contact or apprehension or with knowledge on the part of the actor that such contact or apprehension was substantially certain to be produced"

*** Reasoning

    The opinion says that the facts could support the conclusion but that it would be possible to focus more on them to determine the knowledge of the boy. "While a finding that Brian had no such knowledge can be inferred from the findings made, we believe tht before the plaintiff's action i nsuch a case should be dismissed there should be no question but that the trial court had passed upon that issue;"

*** Holding

    The knowledge the boy had at the time should be investigated before the complaint is dismissed.

*** Main Takeaway

    Intent is a subjective standard relating to the purpose of the actions or the knowledge the person had.

*** Rule

    Appellants are clearly liable for the damages caused by their mistake, nowithstanding they were acting in good faith.

*** Reasoning

    The law does not require intent to harm but that the act was intentional.

*** Holding

    the lower judgment finding liability for the dog was correct.

*** Main Takeaway

    Mistake is not a defense to liability. Mistake is not accidental

** mcguire v almy

*** Procedural History

Supreme Judicial Court of MA, 1937

Can't discern what the lower court held

*** Questions Presented

Can the mentally ill form the intent necessary for intentional torts, here intentional tort of battery.

*** Rule

"in order that an act may be done with the intention of bringing about a harmful or offensive contact ... the act must be done for the pupose of causing the contact or apprehension or with knowledge on the part of the actor that such contact or apprehension is substantially certain t obe produced."

*** Reasoning

There have been criticisms of the united states intent based tort system as the rest of the world seems to have settled on a fault based system. The rule is proven, consistent and does comport with our notions of "essential justice" rather than theorems arising from axioms of civil liability.

*** Holding

The insane are not barred categorically from forming intent for intentional torts. "To be liable, must have been capable of tentertaining that same intent and must have entertained it in fact".

** talmage v smith

*** Procedural History

Supreme court of michigan, 1894

Lower court issued instructions that stating that if the defendant threw the stick, not intending to hit anyone, there was no recovery; if he threw the stick, intending to hit someone, but it was a reasonable amount of force there is no recovery; if he threw the stick intending to hit someone and the force used was unreasonable, then it did not matter that he struck someone else. Jury found in favor of plaintiff and defendant appeals.

*** Questions Presented

A man threw a stick at one boy who was on the roof of one of his sheds and hit another boy, causing loss of sight in his eye. Is the man liable for intentional battery. For the purposes of the intentional tort of battery, did Smith intend to hit make contact with talmage?

*** Rule

If in the attempt to commit an intentional tort you commit another tort among the historical trespass causes, the intent to commit the one will satisfy the intent to commit the one actually committed.

*** Reasoning

The right of recovery lie in intentional causing of damages

*** Holding

The defendant committed an intentional battery.

*** Main Takeaway

Among the old actions of trespass, "when the defendant intends any one of the five, and accomplishes any one of the five, the doctrin applies and the defendant is liable, even if the plaintiff was not the intended target". Note that the first jury instruction would appear to be assault and would constitute a battery under the theory of transferred intent.

** Bazely v Tortorich
   Supreme Court La 1981
*** Procedural History
**** Facts
     Garbage man suing his employer and 3rd parties for some kind of accident on the job. Alleges that driver _intentionally_ did not blow the horn and that therefore the consequences of the accident that follows are attributable to an intentional tort claim.
**** Lower Court Ruling
     Sustained no cause of action against Bazley as it was a negligence claim in a work-related injury and by statute all such claims are exclusively workman's comp claims. The appellate reversed stating that the exclusive remedy applies only to the employer and not 3rd parties.
*** Questions Presented
    Can an intentional tort claim lie in voluntary acts with damages?
*** Rule
    "The meaning of 'intent' is that the person who acts either (1) consciously desires the physical result of his act, whatever the liklihood of that result happening from his conduct; or (2) knows that that result is substantially certain to follow from his conduct, whatever his desire may be as to that result"

*** Reasoning
Intent is taken as voluntary rather than an eye towards consequences. Plaintiff tries to establish that any voluntary act at the beginning of a chain of events entitles to intentional tort claims. However, the above rule is the correct rule for intent. It is a desired or substantially certain outcome. Intentionally not blowing the horn does not impute intent to all of the consequences after.

*** Holding

There is no intentional tort claim.

** Caudle v Betts

*** Procedural History

**** facts
     At a christmas party, hijinks included charging a capacitor and shocking others. the owner of the dealership got in on the joke and shocked Caudle. Got a headache and left the party, passed out frequently in the months ahead, headaches. Eventually has surgery severing occipital nerve leaving a slight numbness on the right side of the head but alleviates the problems. Brings action for battery.

**** lower court
     Both lower court and appellate court dismiss as the injury was not intentional.

*** Questions Presented
    Is an injury, completely unforseable, arising from a a joke, compensable under tort law.
*** Rule
    Intent does not discriminate on motive; acting in a joking manner, unaware of risk or even in the interests of the person still give rise to intentional torts.
    "Liability for resulting harm extends, as in most other cases of intentional torts, to consequences which the defendant did not intend, and could not reasonably have forseen"

*** Reasoning
    When damages arise, it is better for the person intentionally causing them to bear the damages.

*** Holding
    There was a battery and it attaches Liability to Betts for the damages resulting regardless of forseability.

** Davis v White
   United States Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District VA

*** Procedural History

**** Facts

     White intended to shoot another, and hit Davis, aiming for the person fleeing on his motorcycle.

**** Procedural history

     Judgment in favor of Davis. Now before a federal bankruptcy judge seeking to discharge the debt.

*** Questions Presented

    Does a battery under the transfer of intent theory satisfy the "willful and malicious" element of 11 USC 523(a)(6): "for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity;"


*** Rule

    "A debt incurred from an action based upon a willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another person may be nondischargeable in bankruptcy."

*** Reasoning

    The transfer of intent doctrine imputes intent to the actor; "there need be no actual intent to injure the particular person who is injured". The law holds that the act is unlawful and is intentional and so damages are compensable.

*** Holding

    "The evidence here clearly shows that the shooting was a wrongful act intentionally done and that Davis's injuries resulted from that act. White deliberately, intentionally, and maliciously fired the gun and injured Davis and the debt arising from that act is nondischargeable in bankruptcy".

*** Main Takeaway

* battery

** cole v turner

*** Holding

1. That the least touching of another in anger is a battery
2. If two or more meet in a narrow passage, and without any violence or design of harm, the one touches the other gently it will be on battery.
3. If any of them use violence against the other, to force his way in a rude inordinate manner, it is a battery; or any struggle about the pasage, to that degree as may do hurt, is a battery.

*** Main Takeaway

    It sets the stage for the "busy world" theory to be expounded later. That there are incidental touches in the world does not lie a claim; but that incidental touches can rise to such if struggle or violence arise. But that the meat of the tort lie in anger.

** wallace v rosen

   Court of Appeals of Indiana, 2002

*** Procedural History

**** Facts

     A mother was visiting a school when a fire-drill commenced. A teacher encountered the mother while talking to her daughter on the stairwell. The teacher (Rosen) put her hand on the plaintiff, Wallace, to get her attention and direct her down the stairs. The Plaintiff fell down the stairs and injured herself.

**** Previous Court Ruling

     The trial court did not enter a jury instruction for battery which is under review in this case. The jury found in favor of the teacher (Wallace) and the school on negligence count.

*** Questions Presented

    Did the Rosen's touching of the Plaintiff satisfy the "rude, insolent, or angry" element of the intentional tort of battery in Indiana.

*** Rule

    In Indiana, battery requies not only a "knowing or intentional touching" but it must be done in a "rude, insolent, or angry" manner.

*** Reasoning
    The world is crowded and there are inadvertent and harmless contacts. Not every contact that leads to injury necessitates a tort. During the firedrill, Rosen had a duty to her students to keep traffic moving and there was an expectation of incidental contact.
*** Holding
    In this humdrum, the touching to get her attention does not rise to finding of "rude, insolent, or angry" and therefore the denying of the jury instructions was proper. The lower court is affirmed.

*** Main Takeaway
    Intentional contact is not necessarily a battery. In the busy world theory, we are expected to bump and touch each other in minor ways without creating legal liabilities all over the place. "the intent with which tort liability is concerned is not necessarily a hostile intent, or a desire to do any harm. Rather it is an intent to bring about a result which will invade the interests of another in a way that the law forbids".

** Fisher v Carrousel Motor Home
   Supreme Court of Texas, 1967
*** Procedural History

**** facts
     Plaintiff, a mathematician working for NASA, was at a luncheon at a hotel. A staff member approached and ripped his plate from his hand stating that a "Negro could not be served in the club". Plaintiff was never touched.

**** procedural history

     The jury awarded $400 for actual damages and $500 in punitive damages. The trial judge set this aside and ruled for the defendant, upheld on appeal.

*** Questions Presented

    Can there be a battery without a touching of a person?

*** Rule

    The battery is against a person, not their body. "To constitute an assault and battery, it is not necessary to touch the plaintiff's body or even his clothing; knocking or snatching anything from plaintiff's hand or touching anything connected with his person, when done in an offensive manner, is sufficient."

*** Reasoning

    Things that are intimately connected to the person form a part of the person. the example given is if you kicked a cane out of an old man's hands; that surely is a battery. The same holds here.

*** Holding

    The "forceful dispossesion of plaintiff Fisher's plate in an offensive manner was sufficient to constitute a battery". The original judgment of $900 is instated with interest.

*** Main Takeaway

    The tort of battery is to protect the inviolability of the person. Things directly grasped with the hands, clothing, etc, all fall under this presumption of inviolability, the violation of which lies a tort.

** Leichtman v WLW Jacor Communications, Inc

   Ohio Court of Appeals, 1994

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     2nd hand smoking advocate goes on radio show, one disk jockey encourages and the other dj blows cigar smoke in

*** Questions Presented

    Can 2nd hand smoke that is, with specific intent, blown into someone's face, give rise to a claim of battery.

*** Rule

    the standard rule for battery

*** Reasoning

    Offensive is met and tobacco smoke has "particulate matter" and is therefore able to, under Ohio law, make contact. With intent, contact, and offense elements met, the elements of battery under Ohio law would be satisfied by the intentional blowing of smoke in someone's face.

*** Holding

    the court overturns lower courts sustained motion for failure to state a claim. Two other rule 12(b)(6) motions are preserved relating to privacy and making a city ordinance actionable by a private party. Notably, the court refuses to consider the question about general intent blowing of smoke and second hand smoke in a room. The case upholds the theory of battery only under specific intent.

* assault

** i de S et Ux v W de S

   At the assizes, 1348

*** Procedural History

    A man approached a tavern door and banged on it demanding wine. A woman appeared from a window demanding he stop. The defendant swung a hatched at her but did not hit her.

    Lower court ruled that lack of harm prevented finding of a trespass.

*** Questions Presented

    In the ancient meaning, can there be a trespass without harm

*** Rule

    Yes, there can. "And so note that for an assault a man shall recover damages, etc."

*** Reasoning

    The reasoning is that it comports with our notion of harm. "There is harm done and a trespass for which he shall recover damages since he made an assault upon the woman..."

*** Holding

    That despite the lack of physical contact or harm, there could still be damages.

*** Main Takeaway

    Underpinning the historical notion that assault, without harm, can still give rise to damages, further separating assault from the negligence style liabilities. There no harm means no recovery whereas assault without harm can still warrant recovery of damages..

** Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill

   Court of Appeals of Alabama, 1933

*** Procedural History

**** Facts

     Mrs. Hill needed a clock fixed and had to go down to the office of western union where Mr. Sapp was working. He had had a few drinks and offered to fix her clock if she would go behind the counter and let him pet and love her, and then he tried to hug and hold her from behind the counter.

     Seemingly in a case deciding if the damages for the assault are attributable to the employer, the question arises of whether there was an assault at all.

**** Lower Court ruling

     Lower court seemed to have ruled that Mr. Sapp assaulted the woman within the scope of his duties leaving the company on the hook. That is overturned but not what our focus is here.

*** Questions Presented

    Can a defendant argue that an assault could not physically have happened as a defense to the assault?

*** Rule

    The judge seems to erroneously think that an assault is an incipient or thwarted battery. "there must be a nintentional, unlawful, offer to touch the person of another in a rude or angry manner under such circumstances as to create in the mind of the party alleging the assault a well-founded fear of an imminent battery coupled with the present ability to effectuate the attempt, if not prevented". Here at issue are the imminent battery and ability to effectuate the attempt elements.

*** Reasoning

    the argument from the defendant is that the counter was of a physical dimension and height to prevent the the ability to effectuate a battery. But with movement the two could have been close enough to have the apprehension of a battery.

*** Holding

    As a matter of law, an assault was not proscribed as a matter of law due to the distance between them. The implications of this distance was a matter fit for a jury to consider however. The jury did just this and the court upholds this aspect but considers that Mr. Sapp committed the assault outside of his employment duties.

*** Main Takeaway

    The fact that perhaps a battery could not have happened does not preclude a finding of assault.

** Dickens v Puryear

   Supreme Court of North Carolina 1981

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Plaintiff was giving alcohol, drugs to teenage daughter of defendants and having sex with her. Defendants lured Plaintiff into the country and beat him along with four masked men. They debated over two hours whether to kill him or castrate him, ultimately delivering an ultimatum that he must go home and then flee the state otherwise they would kill him. After one year but before three years plaintiff brings the suit. the statute of limitations expires at one year for assault and battery and for three years for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

**** lower court rulings

     With the timebar on assault, defendant colors the action under intentional infliction of emotional distress. Debate about whether this is the nature of the crime or a way to get a trial not procedurally barred but in substance about assault. Lower courts agree with defendants that this is assault and battery and the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, granting summary judgment.
*** Questions Presented

    Does a threat to kill someone in the future constitute an immediate threat of harmful offensive conduct?

*** Rule

    Assault concerns threats of immediate or imminent harmful contact.

*** Reasoning

*** Holding

    The future threats, if actionable, would rightly fall under intentional infliction of emotional distress. The

*** Main Takeaway

    This case seems to be all about IIED. I'm not sure why its in the assault section. There are cool procedural problems in it that seem like they aren't part of Torts 1.

* false imprisonment

** Big town Nursing Home, Inc. v Newman
   court of Civil Appeals of Texas, 1970

**** facts

     Plaintiff checked into nursing home at age of 67 by his son. Check in papers state he is free to leave. Goes to call a cab, phone priviliges are revoked. Tries to get out, locked in the insanity wing, repeatedly strapped to chair for periods of time up to 5 hours. Resident doctor was merely a resident whose only patients were nursing home residents; nursing home tried to change payment of social security checks without plaintiff's knowledge. After 51 days manages to escape to Dallas having lost 30 pounds over the overdeal.

**** lower court ruling
     Appeal by defendant Nursing home against the size of the judment in favor of Newman.

*** Questions Presented

    I'm not sure. This looks like an easy prima facie case.

*** Rule

    False imprisonment is the direct restraint of one person of the physical liberty of another without adequate legal justification.

*** Reasoning

    Issued a remittitur to lower award which plaintiff accepts.

*** Holding

    This was "ample evidence" that the jury was correct in finding false imprisonment.

** Parvi v. City of Kingston
   Court of Appeals of New York, 1977

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Plaintiff was with two brothers in an alley in a 'noisy altercation' apparently drinking. Said he did not have a place to go; drove him to an abandoned golf course rather than arrest him. Ambles onto the thruway and struck by a car severely injuring him. Has no recollection

**** lower court ruling

     Trial court dismissed claim, appeal reversed. New york has as its highest court the court of appeals above the supreme court.

*** Questions Presented

    Can someone with no recollection of the alleged false imprisonment satisfy the awareness of confinement element of false imprisonment.

*** Rule

    New York state has ruled that "awareness of confinement" is a necessary element. However, there is a distinction of awareness at the time of confinement and subsequent recollection of the awareness.

*** Reasoning

    False imprisonment is an assault on the dignity of the person; as such it requires the diginity contemplate its injury at the time. The plaintiff was drunk at the time and does not remember the occurrences. However, there is testimony supporting the fact that plaintiff was aware of the arrest at the time. This is best left to a jury to decide.

*** Holding

    The lack of recollection does not preclude, as a matter of law, the theory of false imprisonment and it is for a jury to weigh the facts to determine if the claim is met.

** Hardy v Labelle's distributing co.

   Supreme Court of Montana, 1983

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Hardy was accussed of stealing store merchandise. Under pretense of a tour, she was led into an office and administered a lie detector test with 1 or 2 officers present and the stores loss prevention officer. The encounter lasted from 20-45 minutes with the test confirming her story of not stealing.

**** lower court ruling

     the lower court informed the jury of a false imprisonment instruction and the jury found for the defendant.

*** Questions Presented

    Can a claim of false imprisonment sustain without a threat of force component?

*** Rule

    Two key elements of false imprisonment
1. restraint of an individual against his will and
2. the unlawfulness of such restraint

*** Reasoning

    The plaintiff was free to leave at any time with no threat of force. While true, she may have suffered economic damages in the loss of her job, these consequences are not the type contemplated by the element in "force, threat of force, duress, or asserted legal authority". At no point did anyone say that she was unable to leave; she was free to leave at any time. Although she followed under pretense of a tour, she testified that she wuld have attended the meeting to exonerate herself if she had known its true purpose.

*** Holding

    the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.

*** Main Takeaway

    False imprisonment can be defeated by a willing participant. Further, while some coercion can rise to the threat needed for detain an individual, economic reasons do not meet this threshold.

** Enright v. Groves
   Colorado Court of Appeals, 1977

*** Procedural History

**** facts
     Officer Groves (D) followed a dog running back to its apparent owners house, intending to cite the owner for failure to keep the dog on a leash. there he encountered a boy who confirmed that the dog was his and that his mother was sitting in her car. He approached the car and asked for Enright's (P) driving license. She stated her name and address but refused multiple times to give license. D offered ultimatum of license or jail to which P responded, "Isn't this ridiculous?"

**** lower court ruling
     Defendant appealing from judgments against them giving $1500 to Plaintiff for false imprisonment.

*** Questions Presented

    Is a police officer open to claims of false arrest when he arrests someone without probable cause or a warrant?

*** Rule

    "False arrest arises when one is taken into custody by a person who claims but does not have proper legal authority... Conviction of the crime for which one is specifically arrested is a complete defense to a subsequent claim of false arrest."

*** Reasoning

    While temporarly close, the arrest was for a separate alleged violation, failure to produce the drivers license. There are no authorities granting this power when not connected to the operation of an automobile.

*** Holding

    The police officer is open to the claim and the lower finding for the plaintiff stands.

** Whittaker v Sandford
   Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, 1912

*** Procedural History

**** Facts

     P's husband is a minister in a cult, D is leader of cult in then Palestine. P wants to leave the cult and travel back to America. D offers ride on his yatch and makes promises to skeptical P that he won't try to force her to rejoin the cult. When in harbor at America, D prevents P from leaving for a month

**** Lower Court Ruling

     Found in favor of P and awarded $1000 damages

*** Questions Presented

    Can the physical restraint element of false imprisonment be satisfied when the means of egress are not provided and there is no other method of leaving?

*** Rule

    The restraint must be physical.

*** Reasoning

    Just as a lock in a door would provide a physical barrier to leaving, so does the non-producing of boats to leave the yatch satisfy the physical restraint element of false imprisonment. The boats were under his control and the meaning of the agreement was clear enough that he was to deliver her to shore, not just a harbor.

    the restraint must be physical, in the sense that you are physically prevented from leaving, rather than you are physically held down. A locked door would physically prevent you from leaving a room. The yacth forms the door and the boat to leave for shore forms the key in this instance.

*** Holding

    The jury was correct in finding for P for the claim of false imprisonment.

* Intention Infliction of Emotional Distress

** State Rubbish Collectors Ass'n v Siliznoff

*** Procedural History

**** Facts

     A man collected the garbage from a restaurant. The local garbage collectors association brought him to a meeting and told him that he had intruded on another's turf. He was told that if he did not sign papers to promise to pay the person who normally collected that garbage otherwise his truck would be burned or worse. He, after two hours, agreed to sign the paper. Following the meeting, the defendant was unable to work and became ill and vomited for several days. He did not pay the man and the garbage collectors bring suit for breach of contract.

     Plaintiffs allege that all of their threats were to take place in the future so they gave no claim to assault.

**** lower court

     Jury veridict for Defendant Siliznoff 1250 general and 4000 punitive which the association appeals.

*** Questions Presented

    Does a cause of action lie when, "in the absence of any privilege, intentionally subject another to the mental suffering incident to serious threats to his physical well-being, whether or not the threats are made under such circumstnces as to constitute a technical assault"?

*** Rule

    "One who, without a privlege to do so, intentionally causes severe emotional distress to another is liable (a) for such emotional distress, and (b) for bodily harm resulting from it."

*** Reasoning

    When assaulted, you can have damages without injury. Same for battery, there can be damages for resulting psychological results. But why do these benefits accrue when the infliction is incidental rather than incidental? The court points to the restatement and shifting sentiment and affirms the lower judgment.

*** Holding

    The lower court is affirmed.

*** Main Takeaway

    The court will recognize the damages in intentional infliction of emotional distress.

** slocum v food fair stores of florida

   florida supreme court 1958

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Plaintiff was in store, the defendant. sought damages for emotional distress or mental suffering, and a resulting heart attack and aggravataing pre-existing heart condition. Attributed to insulting behavior of employee of store while customer. Inquired of price, was dismissive and told "you stink to me". Alternatively, asserts that language used malicious or grossly reckess manner, "or with intent to inflict great mental and emotional disturbance".

**** lower court

     dismissed on "failure to state a cause of action", plaintiff appeals

*** Questions Presented

    Can deliberate rude speech give claim for IIED?

    What is the line between "emotional distress" and "severe emotional distress"?

*** Rule

    "conduct exceeding all bounds which could be tolerated by society, of a nature especially calculated to cause mental damage of a very serious kind"

    Standard is objective rather than subjective.

*** Reasoning

    "there is no inclination to include all instances of mere vulgarities, obviously intended as meaningless abusive expressions". Common carriers, hotels, etc have a special duty against offense but that theory should not extend to here, the general commerce.

*** Holding

    The lower court is affirmed

*** Main Takeaway

    That offensive words are not enough to sustain a claim of IIED

** harris v jones

   court of appeals of maryland, 1977

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     GM, and one of its supervisors, Jones, made fun of a speech impediment of Harris. Allegation of "maliciously and cruelly ridiculed" him, "causing tremendous nervousness, increased the physical defect itself and further injuring the mental attitude fostered by the P toward his problem and otherwise intentionally inflicting emotional distress". Evidence that over 5 month period, 30 interactions verbally and physically mimicked stuttering disability. Asked for a transfer to anothre dept but was refused and chastised for repeatedly seeking assistance of employee grivance officer. Ongoing regular care of physician who notes a decline and prescribes pills to help.

**** lower court

     jury awards 3500 and 15000 punitive against both Jones and GM.

*** Questions Presented

    What is the boundary between severe and mere emotional distress. The court is deciding prong 4 of the tests below.

*** Rule

    outrageous conduct causing severe emotion distress (restatement 46)...

    four elements must be present
1. conduct must be intentional or reckless
2. the conduct must be extreme and outrageous
3. there must be a causal connectoin between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress
4. the emotional distress must be severe

*** Reasoning

    The court held the first two as met and decided they did not have to decide the third as the fourth was lacking. They noted that many wrongs in his life predated the incidents. And the evidence was not legally sufficient to warrant the appellation severe. His nervous condition may have een exacerbated, they were not caused. No evidence was introduced to show his impediment worsened.

*** Holding

    The actions were terrible but the results did not arise to the severity required for the actionable tort. Previous courts may have looked at 4 for damage magnitude but this element is required for a finding in the first case.

*** Main Takeaway

    The resulting emotional distress must be demonstratively severe. Preexisting conditions can give rise to such claims but there must be evidence of worsening in addition to the terrible behavior.

** taylor v vallelunga

   district court of appeal of california, 1959

*** Procedural History

**** facts

**** lower court

     The plaintiff sued for battery. his daughter sued for IIED. Defendants object to the IIED for daughter and sustained, giving ten days for action to be amended. She failed to do so and the claim was dismissed. This is an appeal of that dismissal.

*** Questions Presented

    Can the witnessing of the beating of ones parent be the intentional infliction of emotional distress

*** Rule

    Its an intentional tort so there must be intent

*** Reasoning

    While this claim could be valid, there must be knowledge. Since they did not know that she was present, the beating could not have been done to intentional inflict emotional distress nor could they have known with substantial certainty that emotional distress would be produced by their actions.

*** Holding

    The lower court is affirmed as the intent element is lacking

*** Main Takeaway

** nickerson v hodges

   supreme court of louisiana, 1920

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Plaintiffs were told of a buried treasure by a fortune teller. Defendants filled up a chest with dirt and rocks as a practical joke. The plaintiffs had been searching for months and boarding the fortune teller. The note included in the chest said not to open the inner portion for three days but to tell the heirs. It was intended to be found on april fools but was not discovered until april 14. It was brought to the bank who inspected it. Upon the big reveal three days later, one of the women noticed it had been tampered with and yelled about robbery. One of the plaintiffs flew into a rage. Someone had been gainfully employed but had abandoned it in search of the treasure. Someone had been in an insane asylum previously.

**** lower court

     Verdict in favor of defendants, now before the court on appeal.

*** Questions Presented

    Can the actions of the practical joke arise to some type of IIED

*** Rule

    intentional infliction

*** Reasoning

    Had the woman been alive, they would have awarded substantial damages. the reveal was quite embarrassing, there was quite a bit of reliance on it. During the reveal they were very agitated and there was violence. The woman died swearing she had been robbed.

*** Holding

    As they were unable to award the woman substantial judgments, judgment entered for plaintiff's heirs, now plaintiffs in place, for $500

** White v Monstanto Company and Gary McDermott

   supreme court of louisiana, 1991

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Plaintiffs were waiting for safety material to handle hazardous chemicals at work. While waiting, they were expected to busy themselves. They cleaned and did random work but sat down eventually. Their boss, a long standing employee, berrated and hurled profanities at them for about a minute, and then plaintiff left the area. she went to mcdermott's office, complaining of pounding in her head and difficulty breathing, he suggested a doctor. P spent two days in the coronary care unit and another day in a regular room. Heart attack was ruled out and diagnosis was acute anxiety reaction, a panic attack. released after three days and with medication. returned to work within a week, was paid regular pay while off from work and her medical bills. Continued working there and transferred to mcdermott's department at her own request.

**** lower court

     judgment in favor of white, Ds appeal. Court of appeals affirms the $60,000 damages to employee

*** Questions Presented

    Can a one minute outburst of profanity satisfy extreme and outrageous conduct elemtent for the intentional tort of infliction of emotional distress.

*** Rule

    one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.

    conduct that meets this threshold may be otherwise priviledged under the circumstances. "liability does not attach where teh actor has done no more than to insist upon his legal rights in a permissible way, even though he is aware that such insistence is certain to cause emotional stress." This countenances disciplinary action, where stress is expected perhaps, and is not actionable without a pattern of "deliberate, repeated harassment over a period of time".

*** Reasoning

    "The outburst must be so outrageous and extreme in degree to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." The one minute tirade does not rise to this standard. While using vile language, the outburst did not go "beyond all possible bounds of decency". the defendant knew she was religious, and had an intention to cause some distress as they were employees sitting on the job. "but there is no indication that his spontaneous, brief, intemperate outburst was intended to cause emotional distress of a severe nature".

*** Holding

    reversed as not meeting the extreme or outrageous behavior and lacking in intent not otherwise protected in a disciplinary section.

* Tresspass to land

** dougherty v stepp

   Supreme court of NC 1835

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     neighbor surveys unenclosed land with survey chains, accoutrements and claims land as his own, no marking of trees or cutting bushes. P brings trespass claim

**** lower court

     lower court jury finding of not tresspass

*** Questions Presented

    If a person goes onto unenclosed property for the purposes of surveying, does a trespass to land claim lie?

*** Rule

    every unauthorized, and therefore unlawful entry, into the close of another, is a trespass.

*** Reasoning

    The surveying is mitigation of damages, not a defense of the tort.

*** Holding

    The lower court was incorrect in its jury instructions that surveying was a defense to trespass.

*** Main Takeaway

** Herrin v Sutherland

   Supreme Court Montana 1925

*** Procedural History

**** facts

     Defendant was hunting ducks, standing in land of another, shooting at birds over P's land. P brings action for $10.

**** lower court

     D demurs, overruled, and then never states a defense. P asks for, and receives $1, to which D appeals.

*** Questions Presented

    Does small firearm projectiles constitute a trespass to land.

*** Rule

    The air is almost as inviolable as the land itself.

*** Reasoning

    Historically, land included the infinite space above. The court notes that this will changed as Harvard Law Review was noting that perhaps airplanes might be big in the coming industry. The court notes that a farmer may not have a strong claim against modern artillery thousands of feet above the land, but small arms fire is low, dangerous, and introdues on the "quiet undisturbed, peaceful enjoyment of the plaintiff".

*** Holding

    The lower judgment was correct and the damages upheld.

*** Main Takeaway

    The court never relied on bullets /touching/ Plaintiff's land. It was invading his airspace and causing danger to his enjoyment of the land.
